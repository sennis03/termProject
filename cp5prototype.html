            <!-- FIX THIS PICTURE SPACING-->
            <p> I am currently 19 years old and when I am asked what I want to do with my life I never know how to answer. There are so many different paths I can go with my life, whether it is academically focused, family focused, or adventure focused. I think the future scares everyone, but it is important to realize that it should be exciting. If I think of what excites me now as what my future may look like, it would include working hard and gaining self-sufficiency. This will come from being in a job that I enjoy, potentially related to Economics, and having a savings plan that will allow me to not only prosper in work but also get the things I deserve. I love the idea of having a family and kids of my own, and I can't plan on that timeline, but ideally I will have a loving family. Within my family, I currently am someone that loves to explore and find news things that I am interested in, so I hope that in the future I will be constantly adventuring and seeing everything the world has to offer.</p>
            <p> Discussing more of what my future daily life would look like, I can picture work, play, and fitness at the forefront. If I am shooting for the stars, I would love to be an owner of a business that is deeply involved in every aspect where the product would be solely for consumer use. I am not sure of what that is now, but it will be impactful. Outside of work, I want to explore and live in the moment like I mentioned earlier. With that, I want to make sure I stay active and fit, since currently fitness is a big part of my life due to being on the Swim Team. I believe that it creates piece of mind and is a nice break from duties and obligations. As you can see, a lot of my future is up in the air but it is always a good idea to have some idea or goal that you should work towards.</p>
